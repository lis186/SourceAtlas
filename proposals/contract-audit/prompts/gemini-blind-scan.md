## ROLE

You are performing a blind behavioral contract discovery on one or more source files.
You have NO prior list of contract IDs. You are NOT trying to confirm anyone else's work.
Your only goal is to find every place this code makes an implicit promise to its callers.

The target code may be written in any language (`{language}`). Adapt your analysis accordingly.

## WHAT TO LOOK FOR

Scan for all eight categories of behavioral contracts:

| Category | What to look for |
|----------|-----------------|
| **M** -- Mutation | Side effects that modify data before it leaves the module |
| **L** -- Lifecycle | Implicit state transitions triggered by the module |
| **N** -- Notification | Any pub/sub coupling: events, notifications, signals, message buses |
| **S** -- Synchronization | Blocking, locks, ordering guarantees, thread assumptions |
| **E** -- Error Handling | Swallowed errors, silent fallbacks, special error codes |
| **C** -- Cancellation | What can be cancelled, scope, residual state after cancellation |
| **D** -- Dependency | Implicit reliance on external components, singletons, init order |
| **P** -- Propagation | How effects cross module boundaries: return value chains, parameter mutation, global state changes |

For each behavioral contract you find, record:
- What triggers it (call site, method entry, condition)
- What it does (mutation, state change, event dispatch, lock, error handling, etc.)
- Exact filename and line number
- One-sentence description

## OUTPUT FORMAT

For each contract:

```
Contract: [short title]
Category: [M | L | N | S | E | C | D | P]
Trigger:  [what causes it]
Effect:   [what observable change it makes]
Evidence: [filename:line -- exact code fragment]
```

After listing all contracts, add a summary line:
```
TOTAL CONTRACTS FOUND: [N]
CATEGORY BREAKDOWN: M=[n] L=[n] N=[n] S=[n] E=[n] C=[n] D=[n] P=[n]
```

## Section 4: Boundary Discovery

After listing all contracts, investigate what lies OUTSIDE the provided files.
For each of the following, list files you suspect exist based on the code you see:

1. **Event/Notification Observers**: This code dispatches events or notifications. What classes or modules likely observe them?
   Search for: any observer registration, event listener setup, or subscription calls referencing the same event names.

2. **External Synchronization**: This code uses synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores, actors, mutexes, async barriers). Are there other classes with similar patterns?

3. **Downstream Lifecycle**: This code calls cleanup, teardown, or shutdown helpers. What classes implement them?

4. **Singleton / Global State**: This code reads or writes shared global state. What other modules depend on the same state?

5. **Propagation Endpoints**: This code returns values or mutates parameters that cross module boundaries. What are the likely consumers?

For each finding, output:
```
EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY: [suspected filename or class/module name] -- [reason / what event or call triggers it]
```

If you cannot find evidence, output:
```
EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY: (none found)
```

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Read every line of the provided source file(s). Do not skip sections.
- If you are unsure whether something is a contract, include it and mark it "(uncertain)".
- Do NOT use contract IDs from any other document. Assign no IDs.
- Do NOT produce verification scripts or ast-grep rules. Discovery only.
- Adapt your analysis to `{language}` idioms -- for example, use language-appropriate terminology for events, notifications, lifecycle hooks, and synchronization primitives.
