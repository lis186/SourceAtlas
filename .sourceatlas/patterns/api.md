🗺️ SourceAtlas: Pattern
───────────────────────────────
🧩 API │ 0 files found

## Pattern Not Found in This Codebase

This codebase does not implement traditional "API endpoints" as it is a **Claude Code Plugin** (analysis tool), not a web service.

### What This Project Actually Uses

Instead of APIs, SourceAtlas uses:

1. **Command-based Architecture** - Slash commands (`/atlas.overview`, `/atlas.pattern`, etc.)
2. **Plugin System** - Claude Code Plugin API
3. **Helper Scripts** - Bash scripts for data collection

## Alternative Patterns You Might Be Looking For

Based on this codebase's architecture, you might want to explore:

| Pattern | Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Command Interface** | `/atlas.pattern "command"` | Learn how commands are structured |
| **Plugin Architecture** | `/atlas.overview` | See the overall plugin structure |
| **Script Integration** | `/atlas.pattern "bash script"` | Learn helper script patterns |

## If You Were Looking for Web API Examples

This project includes **test targets** from other projects:
- `test_targets/python-fastapi/` - FastAPI examples
- `test_targets/vendure/` - TypeScript API examples

You could analyze those instead:
```bash
cd test_targets/python-fastapi
/atlas.pattern "api endpoint"
```
